<!-- ****** Description ****** -->

This repository contains the code that will be used for the Association
for the Sciences of Limnology and Oceanography (ASLO) 2025 workshop
Accessing, Cleaning, and Gap-Filling NEON Datasets
(<https://aslo.secure-platform.com/2025/solicitations/16/sessiongallery/2060>).

<!-- ****** Prep ****** -->

## Preparation for the workshop

1.  Optional, but very helpful! Create an API token using the
    instructions in the following tutorial, which shouldnâ€™t take more
    than 10 minutes
    (<https://www.neonscience.org/resources/learning-hub/tutorials/neon-api-tokens-tutorial>)
2.  Ensure that you have R version \>3.6 installed on your computer.
3.  The tutorial leaders will use RStudio, which is also recommended,
    but optional.
4.  Install required packages: neonUtilities, ggplot2, lubridate, plyr.
    Feel free to use lines 75-78 of the NEON-AIS-data-AEMON-J-DSOS.Rmd
    script in this repository.
